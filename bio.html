    Beginnings with RCB (2007)
In 2007, the Board of Control for Cricket in India introduced the Indian Premier League, a franchise-based T20 league. Among the franchises, Royal Challengers Bangalore, owned by Vijay Mallya at the time, selected Kohli to join their team for a sum of $50,000 through a draft. This decision was influenced by his performance in the U19 World Cup in Malaysia which India won under him.[136]

Early seasons (2008–2012)
In the first season, Kohli's performance gave a total of 165 runs and RCB secured the 7th position on the points table.[137] In the next season, the team made it to the playoffs.[138] During the semi-final against Chennai Super Kings, Kohli led RCB to the final.[139] But in the final against Deccan Chargers, RCB fell short by a meagre 8 runs, thus concluding the season as the runners-up.[140]

During the 2010 season, Kohli was the vice-captain. His standout performance came in an encounter against the Deccan Chargers, where he scored 58 runs at a strike rate of 165.[141] RCB made it to the playoffs but in the semi-final against Mumbai Indians, the team faced a defeat of 35 runs, ending the season's campaign.[142] In the Champions League T20, Kohli scored 49* runs against the Lions, guiding his team to the semis.[143] They lost to the Chennai Super Kings by 52 runs, thus ending their tournament's run.

Prior to the 2011 season of the IPL, Kohli was the sole player retained by Bangalore, for an amount of US$1.8 million.[144] He scored 56 runs against the Delhi Daredevils, and was awarded the player of the match for the first time in the tournament.[145] Against the Pune Warriors, he claimed his second player of the match award and became the leading run-scorer of the season, donning the orange cap, also surpassing 1000 IPL runs.[146]

With captain Daniel Vettori sustaining an injury, he captained the team for the first time.[147] RCB ended the league stage at the top position on the points table.[148] They reached the final but fell short of the win.[149] During the season, Kohli amassed 557 runs with 4 half-centuries, becoming the second-highest run-scorer after Chris Gayle.[150]

In the Champions League, the team reached the finals with many crucial knocks by Kohli but lost to Mumbai Indians by 31 runs.

Halfway into the 2012 season, Daniel Vettori stepped down as the captain and handed the role to Kohli for the rest of matches.[151] He contributed to the team's chase in a must-win match but his dismissal led to a batting order collapse, thus resulting in a defeat.[152]

Leadership and rise in form (2013–2016)
After Vettori's retirement, Kohli assumed the role of full-time captain for RCB starting from the 2013 season.[153] With a strong start to the season that saw RCB occupying the top position in the table, the team's performance fell in the latter half of the tournament.[154]

The 2014 season was a mixed bag with the team facing several challenges. But Kohli's popularity continued to soar, making him the most-searched player on the internet during the tournament.[155] During the 2015 season, key changes were made and the team made it to the playoffs but then lost in qualifier two. Through the season, Kohli hit a total of 505 runs in 16 matches the third-highest run tally achieved by him in a single season.[156]

In the 2016 season, Kohli shared 3 century partnerships with de Villiers.[157] His match-winning knocks and technical proficiency received appreciation.[158] In the final, RCB fell short by 8 runs.[159] He was the highest run-scorer of the tournament and won the Orange Cap as well as the title of the most valuable player with 973 runs in 16 matches at an average of 81.08.[160] Additionally, he hit the most sixes, had the most centuries as well as had the best average of the season.

Fluctuating form and exit from captaincy (2017–2022)
In the 2017 season, Kohli grappled with a shoulder injury, which sidelined him for the initial three fixtures of the tournament.[161] The team had a poor tournament while he scored a total of 308 runs in 10 innings.[162]

He is a consummate surgeon at the crease, intensely focused, working hard, playing the ball into gaps in the field and staying calm under pressure. He is always judging the right time to consolidate and the right time to seize a game by the scruff of the neck.

— AB de Villiers
During the 2018 season, RCB retained Kohli for sum of ₹17 crore (US$2.0 million), making him the league's most expensive player at the time.[163] He surpassed 500 runs in the season, a feat he accomplished for a record fifth time.[164] RCB's poor bowling attack led to their elimination from the tournament.[165] In the 2019 season, his form dipped as he struggled for consistency. RCB, as always heavily reliant on him, was eliminated.[166]

During the 2020 season, RCB won five of the 8 matches, but fizzled out during the latter part.[167][168] They qualified for the playoffs on the basis of their net run rate but could not make it to the finals.[169] In the 2021 season, the team qualified for the playoffs, but lost in the eliminator. Kohli officially announced the end of his tenure as the captain of RCB.[170]

In the 2022 season, Kohli was retained for a sum of ₹15 crore (US$1.8 million).[171] Faf du Plessis took over the captaincy duty and the team made it to the playoffs again but then lost in the eliminator and qualifier 2.

Milestones and maiden title win (2023–2025)
In the 2023 season, Kohli assumed the role of a stand-in captain in the absence of du Plessis.[172] His performances led to him clinching the record of most centuries in the league. RCB was eventually eliminated and Kohli ended the season with 639 runs at an average of 53.2 and a strike rate of 140.[173]

In the 2024 season, RCB was on a 6 game losing streak, but made a brilliant and iconic turnaround, with a 6 game winning streak in the season's second half. This comeback was called the blueprint by Chennai Super Kings coach Stephen Fleming as well as Sunrisers Hyderabad coach Daniel Vettori and player Nitish Kumar Reddy with their teams hoping to do the same in the 2025 season.[174] Kohli surpassed the 8000 runs mark in total and won his second orange cap for being the highest run-scorer with 741 runs.[175]

The 2025 season saw RCB win its first title with all the players dedicating it to Kohli. He wears jersey number 18 and this was season 18 of the league making it very special.[176] He scored 657 runs in 15 innings, becoming him the third-highest run-scorer of the 2025 edition. He averaged 54.75, struck at 146.5, and amassed eight half-centuries. Kohli also broke several records, including the most half-centuries as well as fours.[177] RCB broke many records and even became the only team to have won all their away games in a season.
